Project 1: Popular Movies, Stage 1 (Udacity)

Popular Movies is the first project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. 

The app makes an API call to themoviedb.org which provides the movie data shown within the app. Therefore, an API key is required, but has been omitted from the repository in adherence to Udacity's project submission guidelines. 

If you would like to make your own API call, you can sign up for your own API key at themoviedb.org. Once you have done so, navigate to the gradle.properties file, and insert your own key:

MovieDbApiKey="YOUR API KEY GOES HERE"
